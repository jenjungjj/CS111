   I used the script for Zootopia, a Disney film, for my first source and the script for Spirited Away, a Studio Ghibli film. To compare against these sources, I used the first paragraph of my essay that I wrote for my AN 101 course and a part of the script for Frozen, a Disney movie. 
   My program worked better than I expected because when I used the script for a Disney movie, Frozen, the result was “frozen is more likely to have come from Disney.” My AN101 paper also resulted as being more likely to have come from Disney. I downloaded a few more text files such as the script from Howl’s Moving Castle, a Studio Ghibli movie and my program seemed to return the correct movie industry. My program can be improved by adding more classification methods within the TextModel class.

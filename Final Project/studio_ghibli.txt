Chihiro.
Chihiro, we're almost there.
This really is in
the middle of nowhere.
I'm gonna have to
go to the next town to shop.
We'll just have to learn to like it.
Look, Chihiro, there's your new school.
Looks great, doesn't it?
It doesn't look so bad.
It's gonna stink.
I liked my old school.
Mom! My flowers are dying.
I told you not to
smother them like that.
We'll put them in water
when we get to our new home.
I finally get a bouquet, and it's
a good-bye present. That's depressing.
Daddy bought you a rose for
your birthday. Don't you remember?
Yeah, one.
Just one rose isn't a bouquet.
Hold on to your card.
I'm opening the window.
And quit whining.
It's fun to move to a new place.
It's an adventure.
Wait. Did I take the wrong turn?
This can't be right.
Look, there's our house.
Huh?
It's that blue one on the end.
Oh, you're right.
I must have missed the turnoff.
This road should get us there.
Don't take a shortcut.
You always get us lost.
Trust me. It's gonna work.
What are those stones?
They look like little houses.
They're shrines.
Some people think
little spirits live there.
Dad, I think we're lost.
We're fine. I've got four-wheel drive.
Sit down, please, sweetie.
Honey! Honey!
Slow down! You're gonna kill us.
What's that?
What's this old building?
It looks like an entrance.
Honey, get back in the car.
We're going to be late.
Chihiro.
Oh, for heaven's sake.
This building's not old. It's fake.
These stones are
just made of plaster.
The wind's pulling us in.
What is it?
Let's go in. I want to see
what's on the other side.
I'm not going.
It gives me the creeps.
Don't be such
a scaredy-cat, Chihiro.
Let's just take a look.
The movers will get to
our house before we do.

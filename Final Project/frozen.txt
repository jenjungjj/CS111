There she is. Your majesty! Long live the queen! Queen Elsa. Come drink with us. 
Queen Elsa.
Your Majesty? Are you all right?
There she is! Stop her!
Please, just stay away from me. 
Stay away!
It was an accident. She was scared. She didn’t mean in. She didn’t mean any of this. Tonight was my fault. I pushed her. So I’m the one that needs to go after her. 
Yes. Fine. Do.
What?
Bring me my horse, please.
Anna, no. It’s too dangerous.
Elsa’s not dangerous. I’ll bring her back, and I’ll make this right.
I’m coming with you. 
No, I need you here to take care of Arendelle.
On my honor.
I leave Prince Hans in charge!
Are you sure you can trust her? I don’t want you getting hurt. 
She’s my sister. She would never hurt me. 
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight, not a footprint to be seen.
A kingdom of isolation and it looks like I’m the queen.
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside.
Couldn’t keep it in, heaven knows I tried.
Don’t let them in. Don’t let them see. Be the good girl you always have to be. Conceal. DOn’t feel. Don’t let them know. Well, now they know.
Let it go. Let it go. Can’t hold it back anymore. 
Let it go. Let it go.
Turn away and slam the door. I don’t care what they’re going to say. Let the storm rage on. The cold never bothered me anyways. 
It’s funny how some distance makes everything seem small. 
And the fears that once controlled me can’t get to me at all. It’s time to see what I can do, to test the limits and break through.
No right. No wrong. 
No rules for me. I’m free!
Let it go! Let it go!
I am one with the wind and sky. 
Let it go! Let it go!
You’ll never see me cry. Here I stand and here I’ll stay. 
Let the storm rage on. 
My power flurries through the air into the ground. 
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around. 
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast. 
I’m never going back, the past is in the past. 
Let it go! Let it go!
And I’ll rise like the break of dawn. Let it go! Let it go!
That perfect girl is gone. 
Here I stand in the light of day. 
Let the storm rage on!
The cold never bothered me anyway. 
Of course, none of this would have happened if she’d just told me her secret...ha...she’s a stinker.

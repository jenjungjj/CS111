Gimme your tickets right now, or I’m gonna kick your meek little sheep butt.
Ow! Cut it out, Gideon!
Baa-baa. What’re ya gonna do, cry?

Hey!
You heard her. Cut it out.

Nice costume, loser. What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop?

Kindly return my friends’ tickets.

Come and get ‘em. But watch out, ‘cause I’m a fox and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey. And that killer instinct’s still in our Dunnahh.

Uh, I’m pretty much sure it’s pronounced D-N-A.

You don’t scare me, Gideon.

You scared now?
Lookit her nose twitch. She is scared!

Cry little baby bunny. Cry. 

Oh, you don’t know when to quit, do ya?

I want you to remember this moment.
The next time you think you will ever be anything more than just a stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny.

That looks bad.
Are you okay, Judy?
Yeah, I’m okay.

Here you go.
Wow! You got our tickets!

You’re awesome, Judy!

Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn’t know what he’s talking about.

Well’s he was right about one thing. 
I don’t know when to quit. 

Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits- Tundra town, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few. You’re gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets - or guess what?
You’ll be dead!

Judy, it is my great privilege to officially assign you to the heart of Zootopia. Precinct One, City Center.

Congratulations, Officer Hopps.

I won’t let you down. This has been my dream since I was a kid.

We’re real proud of you, Judy.
Yeah. Scared, too.
Yes.

Really, it’s kind of a proud-scared combo. I mean, Zootopia. It’s so far away. It’s such a big city.

Guys, I’ve been working for this my whole life. 

We know. And we’re just a little excited for you, but terrified.

The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. 

And also bears. We have bears to fear, too. To say nothing of lions and wolves.

Wolves?

You play cribbage with a weasel.

And he cheats like there’s no tomorrow. You know what, pretty much all predators and Zootopia’s full of them. 

Oh, Stu. 

And foxes are the worst. 

Actually, your father does have a point there. It’s in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey.

When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a jerk, who happened to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks. 

Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely.
But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you.

And I put some snacks in there.

This is fox deterrent. 

Yeah that’s safe to have there.

This is a fox repellent.

Okay, the deterrent and the repellent. That’s all she needs.

Check this out!

Oh for goodness sake. She has no need for a fox taser, Stu.

Oh come on. When is there not a need for a fox taser?

Okay, look. I will take this to make you stop talking.
